For the most part, my art (<https://art.djnavarro.net>) is released
under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 licence that allows people to reuse my work so long
as they attribute the work to me and share any derivative works under
the same licence. However, there are some cases where that licence is
too restrictive. To remedy that, this repository contains a subset of my
art that has been released into the public domain under a CC0 licence.
Currently, there are only a few pieces here but I may add more over time
